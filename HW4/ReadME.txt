NOTE:- Since, I am doing a project in this course, I am required to attempt a minimum of 30 points in this assignment. However, I have attempted quesion number 1 and 2, summing up to a total of 40 points.

- The codes for question number 1 (Q1a.ipynb and Q1b.ipynb) have been implemented in Google Colab using a GPU.
- The code for question number 2 (Q2.ipynb) has been implemented using jupyter notebook on my local system.
- All codes are in python3.6+
- The folder contains the following files
	1) Q1a.ipynb (This file contains the implementation of DDPG for mountain car environment as asked in question number 1, including the learning graph)
	2) Q1b.ipynb (This file contains the implementation of DDPG for lunar lander continuous environment as asked in question number 1, including the learning graph)
	3) Q1.txt (This file contains the explanation as asked in part (a), and (c) of question number 1)
	4) Q2.ipynb (This file contains the implementation of Bandit problem as asked in question number 2. All the sub parts of the question are written in the same (.ipynb) notebook)
