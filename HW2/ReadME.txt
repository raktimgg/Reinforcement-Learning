python version 3.7.4

1) Installing the custom environments
	-Libraries rquired - numpy, matplotlib, gym
	-The following 2 environments have been created, namely - 'my_tictactoe' and 'my_pacman'. The source codes of both of these are included in 
	the same folder as this one. To register them with gym, for each of them, go inside each of the directory (named 'my_pacman' for pacman environment and 'my_tictactoe' for tic-tac-toe environment). Inside each of the directory open the terminal and type 'python setup.py install'. After that type 'pip install -e .'. This will install and register the environment with gym.
	- Both the custom linraries have worked on my PC. If you face any problem with installing/registering it, please let me know (email - ee17btech11051@iith.ac.in).
